# Data-Structures-and-Algorithms-2020


I want to revisit the code that I wrote for Coursera's [Data Structures and Algorithms](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-structures-algorithms) specialization. This time around I'm using Java.

There are 6 courses in the specialization:

Course 1 is [Algorithmic Toolbox](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithmic-toolbox?specialization=data-structures-algorithms).
